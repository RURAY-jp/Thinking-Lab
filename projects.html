    <h2>Projects & Activities</h2>
  
    <h3>🎮 Speed Typing Invaders</h3>
    <p>A Python game I developed using Pygame, where players destroy falling words by typing them quickly. It helped me learn object-oriented programming, keyboard input handling, and game loop logic.</p>
  
    <h3>🧒 Coding with Kids Internship</h3>
    <p>I joined an internship where I helped younger students learn programming through fun activities. I learned how to communicate clearly, explain complex ideas simply, and be patient — which also helped me understand coding more deeply.</p>
  
    <h3>📜 Essay: The Meaning of "Good"</h3>
    <p>I wrote a short essay inspired by Nietzsche's quote that “good” is what makes the weak feel safe. I explored how morality is shaped by power, and what that means for modern ethical systems. This essay was a personal attempt to define “good” beyond emotion.</p>
