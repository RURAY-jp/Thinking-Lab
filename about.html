    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m Ryutaro, a high school student based in Japan with a deep interest in how ideas — whether technical, philosophical, or economic — shape the world around us. I enjoy learning how systems work, both in code and in society.</p>
  
    <p>I created this site as a small but personal project to explore those ideas, and to build something on my own from the ground up. It's also a space where I can reflect on what I’m learning, from Python game development to economic theory to existential questions about what is "good."</p>
  
    <p>In college, I hope to major in computer engineering while continuing to explore finance, religion, and philosophy on the side. I believe the most interesting ideas live at the intersection of disciplines — and I want to contribute to that space.</p>
